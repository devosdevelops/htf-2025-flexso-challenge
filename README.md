# Getting Started

Welcome to the Flexso Hack the Future challenge of this year

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

| File or Folder | Purpose                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `app/`         | content for UI frontends goes here   |
| `db/`          | your domain models and data go here  |
| `srv/`         | your service models and code go here |
| `package.json` | project metadata and configuration   |
| `readme.md`    | this getting started guide           |

## How to get started

- Open a new terminal and run `npm i`
- To get the app up and running, it should be sufficient to run `npm start`
- If you want to use the launchpad display when developing, make sure to run `npm run build-apps`
- Places of the apps that should be repaired or expanded upon in the code are marked by a preceding comment that says 'HACK THE FUTURE Challenge'
- For further info, refer to the coaches and the briefing documents

## Useful links

The scaffolding of this app is made with a UI5 frontend - in the /app/frontend folder - and a CAP middleware.
Since these are two of the modern SAP technologies, they enjoy our preference and we will release partial code snippets for them throughout the day.
However you're totally free to just use the .csv files (or the deployed sqlite database) along with the external service and go to work in a model of your choice.
